# League-Tracker
Python bot for discord that track your friend's elo and stats on league

This bot is a V1, im not working on it anymore until I get the acces to an other API key from riot.

Next goals are to clean up the code and remove the french words inside it.
Change automatically the game version so that I dont have to change it manually for datadragon.

Full code rework to change my discord API (support for discord.py is over) 

One other feature is kept secret :)
