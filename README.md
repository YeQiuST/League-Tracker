# League-Tracker
Python bot for discord that track your friend's elo and stats on league

This bot is a V1, im not working on it anymore until I get the acces to an other API key from riot.

Next goals are to clean up the code and remove the french words inside it.
- Change automatically the game version so that I dont have to change it manually for datadragon.

- Full code rework to change my discord API (support for discord.py is over) 

- Add a tft version

- Add a database player 

- Add some automation so that the update for lp is print automatically

Maybe one day i will add a a valorant version to the project whenever riot open the api
